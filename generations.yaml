  - name: "First Generation"

    description: "The original Ford EcoSport was developed by Ford Brazil for emerging markets, particularly South America, based on the Fiesta platform. Featuring compact dimensions combined with increased ground clearance and rugged styling elements, it pioneered the now-popular subcompact crossover segment. The exterior design included a distinctive spare tire mounted on the side-hinged rear door. Powertrain options varied by market but typically included 1.0L and 1.6L petrol engines, with a focus on affordability and durability rather than performance. The interior was basic but functional, sharing many components with the contemporary Fiesta. This generation was never sold in North America or Western Europe, being primarily targeted at developing markets where its combination of small footprint, raised ride height, and affordability proved highly successful."

  - name: "Second Generation"
    start_year: 2012
    end_year: 2023
    description: "The second-generation EcoSport maintained the same basic concept but with significantly modernized design and technology, expanding to global markets including Europe and eventually North America (from 2018). Built on Ford's global B-car platform shared with the Fiesta, it retained compact dimensions but with more sophisticated styling aligned with Ford's global design language. The rear-mounted spare tire became optional in many markets, reflecting the vehicle's expanded urban focus. Powertrain options varied significantly by region, including EcoBoost petrol engines, naturally aspirated units, and diesel options in some markets. The North American version featured a 1.0L EcoBoost three-cylinder or 2.0L four-cylinder. The interior offered improved materials and technology, including Ford's SYNC infotainment system. A significant refresh in 2017 updated the exterior styling, particularly the front end, and substantially revised the interior with a floating touchscreen and improved materials. Despite these updates, the second-generation EcoSport faced increasing competition in the rapidly expanding subcompact crossover segment and was criticized for its side-hinged rear door (which presented challenges in tight parking spaces) and dated platform. Production ended for North America in 2022 and for other markets in 2023 without a direct replacement, as Ford shifted focus to newer crossover models."
